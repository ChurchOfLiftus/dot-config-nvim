# neovim-config

This is just a copy of my NeoVim configuration so I can easily share it with others. Feel free to use as-is, modify it, or just mine it for ideas.

It requires:
	- NeoVim -- it may *kind of* work with Vim.
	- vim-plug for plugin management.
	- a bunch of vim plugins.
	- a NerdFont to display correctly (it assumes Meslo NF in GUI mode).
	- probably makes some other assumptions that I'm forgetting.

Known issues:
	- The custom foldmethod is great, but sometimes does weird things. If this happens, just use ":set foldmethod=marker" or whatever you want on the fly.
